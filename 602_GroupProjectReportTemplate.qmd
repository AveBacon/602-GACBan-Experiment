Describe your experiment design, including: (1) experiment design, (2) treatments, (3) outcome variable(s), (4) sample size, and (5) data cleaning procedures (if applicable) [8-10 sentences]

In order to answer our research question, we designed a 2x2 factorial between-subjects experiment with 4 treatment groups. We tested two nominal independent variables: credibility of information and inclusion of a statistic supporting the information. Credibility of information is provided by including a citation by well-known and credible source, in this case the Mayo Clinic. The statistic included to support the claim that puberty blockers can reduce risk of suicidality was "in some cases by over 70%". The four treatment graphics, including the full text of the infographic, are provided in Figure 1.

The experiment's outcome variable is the degree of support for legislation banning gender-affirming care for minors. This was measured using a 5-point Likert type scale: Strongly Oppose (1), Slightly Oppose (2), Neutral (3), Slightly Approve (4), and Strongly Approve (5). 

To complete the experimental design, respondents first completed an informed consent form and were asked several demographic questions. Third variables of particular interest to our research are age, gender, region, and political affiliation. Furthermore, survey respondents were asked a prior knowledge assessment to determine prior bias and understanding of the topic: "True or False: Puberty blockers are a safe and reversible treatment when prescribed by medical professionals to treat gender dysphoria in transgender minors."

A total of 220 survey responses were collected.

# Analysis

<!--
Which statistical test is used, and why? [3-4 sentences]
-->
To analyze the results of our survey, we will use a two-way factorial ANOVA model. Although the outcome variable is a Likert-type ordinal variable and not continuous, the Likert scale had five levels, which means it can approximate a continuous variable.


Upon exploring the distribution of our experiment variables, we observed high rates of neutral respondents, as well as "I don't know" responses to our prior knowledge assessment.

```{r}
# explore experiment variables
summary(clean_data %>% select(DV_ban, IV_stat, IV_org, manipulation_check, prior_knowledge))
```

Exploring potential third variables to include in our analysis model, we noticed a higher proportion of female respondents than male, an even distribution of education level, region and age, and a very high proportion of responses from Democrats (90%). Although political affiliation is likely related to our outcome variable, we cannot include such a skewed predictor in the model. The other 4 demographic variables will be included as third variables in the ANOVA model. 
```{r}
# explore demographic variables of interest
summary(clean_data %>% select(gender_mfnb, education_cat, region_txt, political_party_dri, age_cat))
```


<!--
Run the chosen test! To do so: (1) import the libraries you need, (2) import your data, (3) double-check the names of your IV(s) and DV, and (4) run the test. For information on the libraries and R syntax, refer to see Lecture 10.
-->

Prior to running the ANOVA model, we wanted to see if our manipulation check and outcome variable demonstrated consistent results. To do this, we collapsed the 5-level Likert scale outcome to a 3-level scale (Oppose, Neutral, Support) to fit the scale of the manipulation check. Then, we test Cronbach's alpha, which produces a value of -0.4. Thus, the manipulation check and outcome variable are not consistent. Of note, respondents who answered "do not support" to the manipulation check are very split on their support for legislation banning this care.
```{r}

# explore consistency with manipulation check, throw out any inconsistent results -- test for cronbach's alpha?
table(clean_data$manipulation_check, clean_data$DV_ban)
ltm::cronbach.alpha(clean_data %>% select(manipulation_check, DV_ban_3), CI=T, standardized=T)
```

Run the ANOVA analysis. We report neither of our independent variables nor their interaction term as statistically significant predictors of our outcome variable. The only third variable will a statistically significant relationship to the outcome variable is gender. 
```{r}
# confirm numeric structure of the data
str(clean_data %>% select(DV_ban_num, IV_org, IV_stat, gender_mfnb, region_txt, age_cat, education_cat, manipulation_check, prior_knowledge))

# Two-way ANOVA with interaction using 5-category outcome (numeric)
aov_results <- aov(DV_ban_num ~ IV_org * IV_stat + gender_mfnb + region_txt + age_cat + education_cat + manipulation_check + prior_knowledge, data = clean_data)
summary(aov_results)
```

Due to the inconsistency between our outcome variable and manipulation check, we also explore using the manipulation check in place of our outcome variable. Specifically, we are curious if the measured independent variables have an effect on support for gender-affirming care.
```{r}
# manipulation check as outcome
aov_results <- aov(manipulation_check_num ~ IV_org * IV_stat + gender_mfnb + age_cat + education_cat + region_txt + prior_knowledge, data = clean_data)
summary(aov_results)
```

# Results
<!--
Report and interpret the test results. For information on what should be included, refer to lecture 10. Also add at least one plot.
-->

We were testing 3 hypotheses in our experiment: <br></br>
**H1:** Exposure to factual information presented by a credible source will have a negative impact on the support for legislation banning gender-affirming care options.<br></br>

**H2:** Exposure to factual information presented alongside a statistic will have a negative impact on the support for legislation banning gender-affirming care options. <br></br>

**H1 & H2 results:** These hypotheses are related, and therefore we combined the results in a single plot. <br></br>

**H3:** Participants may have prior experience with the topic of gender-affirming care before exposure to experimental treatments. Prior misconceptions about medical transition among youth will likely lead to higher support for bans. Vice-versa, participants with no prior misconceptions will likely have higher congruence with credible trans-affirming information. <br></br>

**H2 results:** Since our experiment had 2 independent variables, these results are reflected in 2 plots.  <br></br>
